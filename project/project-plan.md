# Project Plan

## Title
Hotel Booking Demand Analysis

## Main Question

Analyze hotel booking trends in different weather conditions. Predict demand based on historical booking data and weather information.

## Description

The primary objective of this data science project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of hotel booking trends and their correlation with weather conditions. By leveraging historical booking data and weather information, the project aims to develop insights into how varying weather conditions influence hotel demand. Additionally, the project seeks to build predictive models for estimating hotel booking demand based on these factors.
